- title:  Embedded Software Developer and Team Leader | Solid Aero
  from: 09/2024
  to: 05/2025
  description: I worked as an Embedded Software Developer and Team Leader in a team
              focused on developing and researching various UAV concepts and applications in 
              the aviation sector. I actively contributed to end-to-end software solutions for 
              "Talay," the world’s first low-altitude multi-purpose UAV, and "ZADA," a medium-range
              VTOL fixed-wing UAV. I developed C and C++ based firmware to integrate ground effect
              algorithms into flight control software. I designed a system enabling ISR payloads
              to transmit Full HD video streams at 8 Mbps with 200 ms latency during flights. 
              Additionally, I developed ground unit control systems capable of 100 km data 
              transmission over the 1.4 GHz band, along with operator interfaces based on
              Qt Framework, JavaScript, and C++. I applied object-oriented design patterns 
              to ensure efficient and sustainable software architecture. I enhanced LRS-based
              data and telemetry systems for jamming resilience by developing solutions 
              operating on the P frequency band. Beyond development, I led project management
              and customer/investor presentation processes, strengthening communication 
              channels. Working in a high-paced environment with flexible hours, I adopted
              Agile methodologies to boost team collaboration and managed project tracking
              through JIRA, MS Project, and Notion.

                 
                

- title: Project Development Manager | Boni Global
  from: 03/2024
  to: 09/2024
  description: At Boni Global, an engineering firm actively operating in the field of
                Industrial Aviation and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems, I served as a Project
                Development Manager. In this role, I led software development projects for UAVs and
                UAV systems, actively participating in all stages from project initiation to delivery.
                During the project management process, I took responsibility for critical
                tasks such as project planning, resource allocation, risk management, and
                progress tracking. I effectively applied Agile methodologies to foster
                strong communication and collaboration among team members. I continuously
                monitored project goals to ensure timely and budget-compliant delivery,
                taking corrective actions when necessary.
                Additionally, I managed field testing processes for developed products,
                contributing to improving product quality and ensuring active monitoring
                and updates throughout the lifecycle.


- title: Embedded Software Developer and Team Leader | Hiyellab
  from: 04/2023
  to: 01/2024
  description: I worked as a Developer and Team Leader at Hiyellab, a company focused on
              the development and research of IoT-based systems for the Machinery and Industrial
              sectors. During this time, I actively contributed to two major projects. The first
              project involved the development of a Tethered Lighting Drone and a Drone Port
              system. I was responsible for developing C++ and Python-based mission software 
              for a hexacopter platform and integrating key avionics components such as a 
              SoM-based mission computer, power management systems, and control mechanisms 
              for emergency lighting scenarios. I collaborated with a 14-member team, contributing
              to project management and investor/customer presentations, while enhancing team
              communication through Agile methodologies. The second project was the development
              of an IoT-based Smart Water Consumption System. In this project, I developed 
              embedded software for ESP and LoRa-based irrigation control mechanisms, enabling
              interactive user control over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protocols. I also contributed
              to prototyping multi-node communication algorithms in LoRaWAN-based systems.

- title: Software Developer | Ada Güzey R&D
  from: 02/2022
  to: 09/2023
  description: I worked as a Software Developer at Ada Güzey R&D, supported by the EIM Consortium.
                I contributed to two key projects during this time. The first project was the "TikiTaka Pass
                Trainer," commissioned by the Ministry of Youth and Sports to promote sports habits among 
                Turkish youth. In this project, we developed a real-time electromechanical system with 20 sensors
                integrated into a kiosk-based application. Using JavaScript and Django frameworks for user 
                interaction, and an embedded Linux system running on a Single Board Computer, we achieved 
                synchronized operation with a 15ms response time. Throughout the project, I gained extensive
                experience with C++, C, Python, and embedded development on Arch Linux systems.

                The second project involved the development of a 4G-based Cargo Drone and Drone Port system,
                funded by the European Union under a partnership model. I was responsible for designing the
                avionics systems of both the drone and the port, developing 4G communication architectures,
                implementing autonomous navigation integrated with the drone port, and building human-machine
                interaction interfaces. The telemetry and data transmission system was cloud-synchronized 
                across the drone, the drone port, and the operator interface with approximately 200ms latency.
                Throughout the project, I maintained regular communication with stakeholders and consortium juries,
                delivering multiple presentations. The project concluded with a successful final presentation 
                to the Municipality of Belgrade, Serbia.

- title: Intern | Serkon Technology
  from: 07/2022
  to: 08/2022
  description: I worked as an intern in the R&D Department at Serkon Teknoloji, a company specializing
              in textile machinery and fabric inspection systems, exporting to over 70 countries.
              During my internship, I conducted current and voltage analyses of laser cutting 
              machine stepper motor drivers in both time and frequency domains to detect motor 
              faults. I also developed bare-metal programming on STM32-based ARM microcontrollers 
              and implemented signal processing algorithms for stepper motor drivers in the 
              frequency domain. I actively used C and C++ programming languages throughout 
              the projects. Although I was offered a position as an R&D Engineer at the end 
              of my internship, I declined the offer to continue my university education.

- title: Junior Software Develoepr | Kapsam Electromachina
  from: 01/2022
  to: 07/2022
  description: I worked as a Junior Software Developer at Kapsam Elektromakina, a company specializing
              in industrial automation and control systems. During this time, I volunteered in two different
              projects. In the first project, I contributed to the productization of a complex industrial
              automation system involving PLCs, conveyor belts, HMI systems, and Local Binary Pattern 
              (LBP)-based deep learning algorithms. I developed Qt-based HMI interfaces and implemented
              control mechanisms for marble blocks of four different quality levels transported on 
              conveyor belts, actively using C++ and Python programming languages. In the second project,
              I participated in the development of an Underground Power Line Detector, supported by 
              state-backed semi-private electricity distribution companies. I worked on embedded software
              development for STM32-based ARM microcontrollers, processing three different coil signals 
              simultaneously and analyzing them in the frequency domain to detect underground lines. I also
              developed bare-metal drivers for signal codecs and designed signal processing algorithms 
              involving DMA and FMAC units. As a result, I successfully integrated all subsystems with a 
              latency of approximately 14 ms.
